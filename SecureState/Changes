Revision history for Perl extension CGI::SecureState.

0.24  Mon Mar 26 14:50:30 2001
	- Fixed silly error ($tmp).

0.23  Thu Mar 22 20:47:40 2001
	- Added Dave Stafford's binmode fix.  Hopefully, the code will
	  now work on Win32.
	- changed delete() to accept multiple arguments
	- fixed namespace instrusion
	  (CGI::SecureState::Devel::counter->CGI::SecureState::counter)
	- updated POD to reflect changes and fix misleading
	  CGI::SecureState::errormsg section
	- changed encipher() and decipher() to allow for single parameters
	  having more than one value
	- changed encipher() and decipher() to escape fewer characters,
	  resulting in smaller state files.
	- changed POD to reflect that I have tested the encryption and
	  decryption and am satisfied that it works.


0.22  Thu Jan 18 17:47:45 2001
	- fixed test.pl spelling error (should be installed)->(should
	  not be installed) and changed it to test the new
	  capabilities of the encipher and decipher functions.
	- fixed POD to not include the blurb about rand() and time()
	  and also add a blurb about age and the update to encipher
          and decipher.
	- added age() method to return the time in days since the last 
	  access of the state file
	- fixed encipher and decipher so that they now support binary
	  keys and values.
	- Changed README and POD to reflect that CGI::SecureState now
	  works with CGI.pm v2.74.
	- Changed test.pl to detect systems without case sensitivity.

0.21  Wed Jan 10 14:48:30 2001
	- fixed test.pl to work with newer versions of CGI.pm.
          New versions (i.e. 2.74) of CGI.pm don't assume command line
	  parameter entry.

0.2  Mon Jan  2 17:10:30 2001
	- first public release.
