Revision history for Perl extension CGI::SecureState.

0.30
	- Updated the README to reflect changes.
	- Updated the Makefile to spit out nasty warnings if 
	  the user was upgrading from a version below 0.29.
	- Updated the Makefile to require Fcntl and File::Spec.
	- Rewrote the POD to reflect changes.
	- Changed test script to use Test::Harness properly.
	- Split test script into pieces with distinct functionalities.
	- Changed the Long-Filenames.t script to use File::Spec to
	  check for a distinction between upper and lowercase filenames.
	- Added lots of portability changes, so CGI::SecureState
	  should work on just about any system now.
	- Added extra_ and paranoid_ security options.
	- Added Symlink Detection support.
	- Added flock support.
	- Changed new() to make a mindset specification mandatory.
	- Changed new() to accept the hash-style argument listing.
	- Added mindsets.
	- Changed errormsg() to be able to deal with more errors.
	- Changed errormsg() to allow for a user error message
          subroutine.
	- Added remember() to save current parameters.
	- Added params() to return more than one CGI parameter at a time
	- Added state_param() to return a name-value pair so other
          scripts can use the same session.
	- Allowed add() to add more than one parameter at a time.
	- Changed encipher() to be able to update the timestamp
	  on the state file if not given anything to encrypt.
	- Changed functionality of encipher() and decipher() to only
	  do encryption and decryption, and added save_memory() and
	  recover_memory() functions to actually interact with the
	  list of parameters in the CGI object.
	- Rewrite of encipher() and decipher() to use reverse-CBC
	  encryption instead of ECB encryption.

0.24    - Quick and dirty bugfix ($test variable not declared)

0.23  Thu Mar 22 20:47:40 2001
	- Added Dave Stafford's binmode fix.  Hopefully, the code will
	  now work on Win32.
	- changed delete() to accept multiple arguments
	- fixed namespace intrusion
	  (CGI::SecureState::Devel::counter->CGI::SecureState::counter)
	- updated POD to reflect changes and fix misleading
	  CGI::SecureState::errormsg section
	- changed encipher() and decipher() to allow for single parameters
	  having more than one value
	- changed encipher() and decipher() to escape fewer characters,
	  resulting in smaller state files.
	- changed POD to reflect that I have tested the encryption and
	  decryption and am satisfied that it works.


0.22  Thu Jan 18 17:47:45 2001
	- fixed test.pl spelling error (should be installed)->(should
	  not be installed) and changed it to test the new
	  capabilities of the encipher and decipher functions.
	- fixed POD to not include the blurb about rand() and time()
	  and also add a blurb about age and the update to encipher
          and decipher.
	- added age() method to return the time in days since the last 
	  access of the state file
	- fixed encipher and decipher so that they now support binary
	  keys and values.
	- Changed README and POD to reflect that CGI::SecureState now
	  works with CGI.pm v2.74.
	- Changed test.pl to detect systems without case sensitivity.

0.21  Wed Jan 10 14:48:30 2001
	- fixed test.pl to work with newer versions of CGI.pm.
          New versions (i.e. 2.74) of CGI.pm don't assume command line
	  parameter entry.

0.20  Mon Jan  2 17:10:30 2001
